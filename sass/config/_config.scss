// Base Partials
//
// These files will be shared across all three of your output CSS files.
// Generally included here are only Compass Extension imports and imports
// for variables, functions, mixins, and extendables.

// A few default variables we want to set BEFORE we import compass.
//
// Why? Well, compass will override these. And to make sure that we can override
// them later for our IE stylesheets, we need to declare them now.
$graceful-usage-threshold:    1         !default;
$critical-usage-threshold:    0.1       !default;
$browser-minimum-versions:    (ie: '9') !default;

// Compass Extensions
//
// Put an extra compass extensions here. Aurora already puts in respond-to,
// susy, toolkit, breakpoint, sassy-buttons, and compass-normalize

@import 'compass';
@import 'breakpoint';
@import 'singularitygs';
@import 'toolkit';

// Private Imports
//
// Any other imports to add. Normally, these do not include any css, but just
// functions, variables, etc. to be used by other files.
@import "functions";
@import "mixins";
@import "variables";
